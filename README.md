# Analog Keypad Library for Arduino

## Introduction

The Analog Keypad Library is an Arduino library that simplifies the process of reading key presses from an analog keypad. It includes features for specifying the number of buttons, key values, ADC values, tolerance, and debounce delay to make working with analog keypads easier.

## Features

- Supports analog keypads with customizable configurations.
- Easily define the number of buttons, key values, and corresponding ADC values.
- Adjustable tolerance to account for variations in analog readings.
- Built-in debounce mechanism to prevent false key presses caused by button bouncing.

## Installation

1. Download the `AnalogKeypad` library folder from this repository.
2. Copy the `AnalogKeypad` folder to your Arduino libraries folder.
   - On Windows, this is typically located at `My Documents/Arduino/libraries`.
   - On macOS, it's located at `Documents/Arduino/libraries`.
   - On Linux, it's typically at `~/Arduino/libraries`.

## Usage

1. Include the `AnalogKeypad` library in your Arduino sketch:

   ```cpp
   #include "AnalogKeypad.h"
   ```

2. Create an instance of the `AnalogKeypad` class, specifying the analog pin connected to your keypad:

   ```cpp
   AnalogKeypad keypad(A0); // Replace A0 with the actual analog pin you're using.
   ```

3. Define the number of buttons, key values, ADC values, tolerance, and debounce delay:

   ```cpp
   int numButtons = 4;
   char keyValues[] = {'1', '2', '3', '4'}; // Adjust to match your keypad layout.
   int adcValues[] = {100, 300, 500, 700}; // Adjust these values based on your keypad.
   int tolerance = 20; // Adjust the tolerance value as needed.
   unsigned long debounceDelay = 50; // Adjust the debounce delay as needed.

   void setup() {
       Serial.begin(9600);
       keypad.begin(numButtons, keyValues, adcValues, tolerance, debounceDelay);
   }
   ```

4. In your `loop()` function, use the `getKey()` function to read key presses:

   ```cpp
   void loop() {
       char key = keypad.getKey();

       if (key != '\0') {
           Serial.println(key);
           // Handle the key press here.
       }

       // Add any other code or functionality you need in your loop.
   }
   ```

## Customization

- Adjust the values in the `keyValues[]` and `adcValues[]` arrays to match your keypad layout and ADC values for each button.
- Modify the `tolerance` value to account for variations in the analog readings.
- Change the `debounceDelay` value to control the debounce time for button presses.
